This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## React Boilerplate

Note: Code in this repository might change in the future. This is mostly a learning project!

This repository contains base packages from `npx create-react-app` as well as React Router. I don't feel like doing all this code all the time when I want to make a project, so I'm gonna try my hand at some automation ðŸ˜¼

The boilerplate code right now is awful simple. No css, and only two React routes. Will be more densly populated soon!

See [this repository](https://github.com/gfriesen98/gboilerplate#readme) for more information!

### This repository only contains the base react code, not the automation script!
